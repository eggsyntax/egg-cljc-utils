# egg-cljc-utils

Contains various utilities that I like to have available at the REPL (I `lein
install` the repo locally, and use [lucid](https://clojars.org/zcaudate/lucid)
in my personal profiles.clj to inject them into the REPL as though they were
functions in clojure.core).

## Usage

Everything's in egg-cljc-utils.core

## License
